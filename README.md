# quickmafs
Quickmafs is a C++ recursive descent parser which can evaluate math expressions, meant for use in Arduino, since we didn't notice any libraries specifically for use in Arduino that did this.  Many functions that you would see on a real calculator are included in this parser such as trig functions, loarithms, powers, roots, and of course the basic mafs.
Yes, the name is a reference to "Man's Not Hot."
